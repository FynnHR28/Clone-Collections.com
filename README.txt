Hello!

 This web app is a project still very much in progress. As a way to practice javascript as well as get
accustomed to Express Js, I created a Wordle Clone playfully named "Lingo Leap". The goal for this site is to
include more games that increase my familiarity with APIs, Node.js, databases, React, and other full stack
skills. The Lingo Leap game should work by downloading the all the code into a directory, navigating to the 
backend folder, and running "npm start" in your terminal. This allows the client facing Javascript to 
make requests to the Express server app in index.js which supplies random words and checks to see if a guessed
word is valid. It goes without saying that my goal is not to get people to play it (landing me in a ton of trouble) , I just had a lot of fun learning the various concepts and seeing the end result!
